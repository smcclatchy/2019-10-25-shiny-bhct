<h2 id="general">General Information</h2>
Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps. Shiny apps are easy to write and don't require web development skills. This workshop will get you started building Shiny apps right away. <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/">Visit the Gallery</a> for examples of interactive web apps built with Shiny.

<strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Software Carpentry's <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/">R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis</a>, or R programming competence obtained otherwise.

To preview the workshop materials, see these <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/#written-tutorials">written Shiny tutorials</a>.

This workshop is open to those from neighboring institutions and is free of charge. Participants must attend in person at the Jackson Laboratory in either Bar Harbor ME or Farmington CT. Remote attendance will not be supported otherwise.

Collaborative Notes

If you want to use an Etherpad, go to

http://pad.carpentries.org/YYYY-MM-DD-site

e.g., '2015-06-10-esu'.
{% endcomment %}

{% comment %}
SYLLABUS

Show what topics will be covered.

1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
intend to teach.
4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
'tools/check' as well.

SETUP

Delete irrelevant sections from the setup instructions.  Each
section is inside a 'div' without any classes to make the beginning
and end easier to find.

This is the other place where people frequently make mistakes, so
please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
'tools/check' as well.

  <h3>R</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a> is a programming language
    that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and
    statistical analysis. To interact with R, we use
    <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>.

          Install R by downloading and running
          <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm">this .exe file</a>

          <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">RStudio IDE</a>.
          Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the 
          installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as 
          administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later, 
          for example when installing R packages.
